# Engineering and Evaluation of AI. Continuous Assessment

# CA_multi-label_email_classification
 implement Chained Multi-output classification.

# Install
 pip install pandas numpy stanza transformers scikit-learn

##
# We used two sets of code to implement a system based on the Chained Multi-Outputs architecture design to support multi-label categorisation
# First set of code
    1. View evaluation results in test.ipynb
    2. Teammate G (Major), Teammate H(Minor)
    3. The submitted description file is based on the first set of code

# Second set of code
    1. run python main.py to see the results of the evaluation
    2. Teammate H (Major),Teammate G(Minor)
